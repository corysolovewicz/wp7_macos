# üçç WiFi Pineapple Internet Sharing on macOS (with VPN Support)

## ‚ùå The Problem

By default, macOS Internet Connection Sharing (ICS):

- **Only shares internet on the 192.168.2.0/24 subnet**
- **Cannot be configured** to use custom subnets via the GUI
- **Assigns IPs via DHCP**, which does not work with the WiFi Pineapple MK7's default static IP configuration
- **Breaks compatibility** with the Pineapple‚Äôs expected interface at `172.16.42.1/24`

When using a VPN, macOS:

- Does **not** route shared traffic through the VPN by default  
- Lacks a built-in way to **NAT traffic from a USB interface to a VPN tunnel**  
- Provides **no direct way to ensure Pineapple traffic is tunneled securely**

This creates friction and reliability issues for red teamers, wireless assessors, or anyone trying to route Pineapple traffic through a VPN on macOS.

## ‚úÖ The Solution: This Script

This shell script sets up secure Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) from your Mac to the WiFi Pineapple MK7 **while preserving the default `172.16.42.0/24` subnet** ‚Äî and routes all traffic through your active VPN connection.

### üîß What the Script Does

1. **Detects the Pineapple's interface** by MAC address prefix `00:13:37`
2. **Assigns a static IP** of `172.16.42.42` to your Mac on that interface
3. **Enables IP forwarding** on macOS
4. **Detects your default outbound interface** (e.g., `utun0`, `ipsec0`) ‚Äî typically the VPN tunnel
5. **Configures NAT** using `pfctl` to route traffic from the Pineapple‚Äôs subnet through the detected VPN interface
6. **Provides a menu interface** to start/stop ICS with optional banners
7. **Enforces VPN routing** by default, with a user prompt override for non-tunnel interfaces

## üõ°Ô∏è Why It Matters

- Ensures that **WiFi Pineapple clients access the internet via your VPN**
- Prevents traffic leakage by requiring or confirming a tunnel interface is in use
- Eliminates the need to reconfigure the Pineapple from its standard network layout
- Avoids modifying macOS‚Äôs ICS GUI settings or launching a DHCP server

## üíª Usage

```
chmod +x wp7_macos.sh 
sudo ./wp7_macos.sh
```

You‚Äôll be presented with a menu to:

- Start Internet Connection Sharing  
- Stop / undo all changes  
- Quit

## üéØ When to Use

- During wireless red teaming or penetration tests  
- When using the WiFi Pineapple MK7 as a rogue AP or MITM relay  
- When you want clean setup/teardown without rebooting or manual configuration
- On macOS systems that must route traffic through a VPN  

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- macOS (tested on Monterey, Ventura, Sonoma, Sequoia)  
- WiFi Pineapple MK7 (default config)  
- Admin/root privileges

## Optional
- Any VPN that creates a tunnel interface (`utunX`, `ipsecX`)  

---

## üö® Revert Instructions

To fully undo changes:

- Run the script and choose `[X] Stop / Undo ICS]`  
- This will:
  - Disable IP forwarding  
  - Remove the static IP from the Pineapple interface  
  - Flush and disable `pfctl`  
  - Clean up `/etc/pf.anchors/com.pineapple.nat`
